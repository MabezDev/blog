This is the next quarterly update of the esp-rs effort, detailing the progress over Q1 2024.

## Rust Compiler

// 

## esp-hal

We've really put a focus on `esp-hal` this quarter, so we have a tonne of updates to share. The biggest update being that we have unified the HAL such that all chips are now supported by a singular package, `esp-hal`. Previously we had a common library with shared implementations, which was then broken out into a hal package for each chip. With each new chip release by Espressif, we realized this was not scalable. We made the decision merge all the HALs into `esp-hal` which has now been released on crates.io! Migration is quite straight-forward, you can checkout the [release notes](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/releases/tag/v0.16.0) for the details.

If you are a contributor, the workflow within the esp-hal repository has also changed. In unifiying the HAL, we realized we have outgrown vanilla cargo as a build tool, and needed something more custom. We have switched to `cargo xtask` to manage building packages, examples, and tests (more on that later!).
