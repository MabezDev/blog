This is the next quarterly update of esp-rs effort, detailing the progress over Q4 2022.

## Rust Compiler & LLVM

Other than the occasional rebase for every Rust release, there is not too much to report on the rust compiler fork. However, we have really exciting news about LLVM. The first 10 patches Xtensa patches have been approved and _committed_ upstream :tada:, you can view them [here](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Allvm%2Fllvm-project+Xtensa&type=commits). This is exciting for us, Espressif has been pushing this upstreaming effort since 2019! So it's very nice to have something upstream, with plenty more patches to follow. At this point, I'd also like to make it clear that you do **not** need the forked compiler for our RISC-V-based chips, esp32c2, esp32c3, esp32c6 etc. You only need the forked compiler for our Xtensa-based chips, esp32, esp32s2 & esp32s3.

[espup](https://github.com/esp-rs/espup), our custom toolchain manager has seen some nice improvements over the quarter. It now leverages `async` to improve installation times, by downloading multiple things concurrently. We switched to espup in our CI pipelines and saw a significant improvement in setup time.
