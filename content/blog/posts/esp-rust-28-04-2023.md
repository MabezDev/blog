This is the next quarterly update of esp-rs effort, detailing the progress over Q1 2023.

## Rust Compiler & LLVM

We have fixed several issues in the LLVM Xtensa backend, mainly relating to the hardware loop optimization feature used on the ESP32 and ESP32-S3 chips [#161](https://github.com/esp-rs/rust/issues/161) [#164](https://github.com/esp-rs/rust/issues/164). We spotted an issue with the 1.67 release where debug builds no longer worked on the ESP32, however, this turned out to be a linker script issue in esp-hal [#158](https://github.com/esp-rs/rust/issues/158).

In the last post, we mentioned that the first 10 LLVM Xtensa patches had been committed upstream, since then we have been preparing the next set and now have 20 patches in review upstream. You can track the progress, as well as review the patches [here](https://github.com/espressif/llvm-project/issues/4#issuecomment-1485724130).


## esp-hal - no_std

First, there were updates to the `embedded-hal-async` and `embassy-*` dependencies, as well as an update to `embedded-hal@1.0.0-alpha.10` and `embedded-hal-nb@1.0.0-alpha.2`, bringing in the latest changes and improvements from the embedded-hal ecosystem [#488](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/488) [#487](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/487).

Initial ESP32-H2 support was added with [#482](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/482) with the addition of soc/efuse methods in [#486](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/486). Debug assist support was added to aid in debugging stack overflow issues [#484](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/484). Additional updates were made to fix comparison errors, decoding of wakeup cause using bitflags, as well as adding support for the RSA peripheral [#473](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/473) [#472](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/472) [#467](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/467).

Improvements were made to the linker script, documentation, and clock control for peripherals such as `timg`, `wdt`, `sha`, `usb-serial-jtag`, and `uart` [#470](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/470) [#463](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/463) [#461](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/461).

Finally, we made several improvements to existing functionality, including allowing setting a timeout for i2c to accommodate devices with longer clock stretching with pull request [#211](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-hal/pull/211), and changing the LEDC Clock enum name/typedef in esp-idf master with pull request [#208](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-hal/pull/208). We also implemented PCNT for the v4 esp-idf api (which will work for v5 with v4 api) with pull request [#157](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-hal/pull/157).

## Tooling

### espflash

Over the past quarter, we and the community have been busy making several improvements and fixes to `espflash`. We started by adding a note about permissions on Linux in pull request [#391](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/391) to ensure that users are aware of the necessary permissions when flashing ESP devices on Linux systems. In pull request [#389](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/389), we made the default flashing frequency target specific to improve the flashing process. We also generated shell completions in pull request [#388](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/388) to enhance the usability of the `espflash` tool.

In addition to these improvements, we also focused on fixing issues and bugs. We fixed the config file parsing in pull request [#382](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/382) and updated the `toml` dependency while fixing errors and feature gating `ctrlc` dependency in pull request [#378](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/378). We also resolved issues with Raspberry CI in pull request [#377](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/377) to ensure smooth integration and testing. Furthermore, we made image header improvements and bugfixes in pull request [#375](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/375), fixed chip revision check during flashing for the ESP8266 in pull request [#373](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/373), and restored the cursor when exiting from serial port selection via Ctrl-C in pull request [#372](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/372).

In terms of new features, we added support for ESP32-H2 in pull request [#371](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/371) and introduced an `ESPFLASH_PORT` environment variable in pull request [#366](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/366) for added flexibility. We also updated the documentation in pull request [#368](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/368) to provide up-to-date and accurate information to users. Additionally, we made several fixes and improvements in pull requests such as [#363](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/363), [#359](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/359), [#358](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/358), [#354](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/354), and [#353](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/353) to ensure the stability and reliability of the `espflash` tool. Overall, our team has been actively working on addressing issues, adding new features, and improving the `espflash` repository to provide a better experience for our users.
