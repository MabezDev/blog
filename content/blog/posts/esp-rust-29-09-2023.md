This is the next quarterly update of the esp-rs effort, detailing the progress over Q3 2023.

## Rust Xtensa Compiler

We had one big bugfix around hardware [floating point unit for ESP32 & ESP32-S3](https://github.com/esp-rs/rust/issues/180), shout out to [@zRedShift](https://github.com/zRedShift) for finding the bug and providing the fix in [llvm-project#76](https://github.com/espressif/llvm-project/pull/76). Along with the bugfix, [@zRedShift] also contributed two code generation improvement patches, one to improve the performance of [`cttz`](https://github.com/espressif/llvm-project/pull/77) and another to improve the performance of [`abs`, `min` and `max`](https://github.com/espressif/llvm-project/pull/78). The Xtensa-related LLVM patches upstream are still in review but are slowly making progress.

## esp-hal - no_std

Q3 saw the `v0.11` and `v0.12` release of esp-hal. Highlights include updating the `embedded-hal-*` packages to `1.0.0-rc.1`, ready for the long awaited `1.0` release of `embedded-hal`; The addition of deep-sleep support for the `ESP32-S3`, and new cryptographic accelerator support for ECC, HMAC and RSA. We've made a start on adding support for the low-power core of the ESP32-C6, with some basic GPIO drivers and support for loading the LP code from the main core. Check out the full [changelog](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for all the details.

## esp-wifi - no_std

We added BLE support for the ESP32-C6 in [esp-wifi#262](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-wifi/pull/262), improved the esp-now async API in [#232](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-wifi/pull/232) along with a bunch of other smaller fixes and improvements! We're gearing up for our first crates.io release, which is long overdue. We've had all the pieces in place for a release, we just didn't get around to doing it! We're currently in the process of improving the docs, and doing some final testing before the release.

## esp-idf-hal - std

Async I2S, SPI, ADC and GPIO were added in [esp-idf-hal#279](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-hal/pull/279), with a follow up PR for UART in [esp-idf-hal#306](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-hal/pull/306). Huge props to [@ivmarkov] for the tremendous effort here. From the latest `v0.42.0` release, ESP-IDF version 4.3 is now deprecated for use with Rust. Please see [ESP-IDFs support schedule](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/versions.html#support-periods) for upgrade paths. See the full changelog for esp-idf-hal [here](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-hal/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## esp-idf-svc - std

Bluetooth classic support (for the esp32 only at the moment) has been added, behind the `experimental` feature flag; BLE is also planned. We are also discussing how to go about adding generic Bluetooth traits in embedded-svc, [here](https://github.com/esp-rs/embedded-svc/issues/32). From the latest release, it will no longer be required to depend on the esp-idf-sys crate or the esp-idf-hal crate directly in your project, instead, this crate will be re-exported by esp-idf-svc as `esp_idf_svc::sys` and `esp_idf_svc::hal` respectively.

## matter-rs / rs-matter

rs-matter (previously, matter-rs, but has been renamed due to an existing crate registered on crates.io) has had its first crates.io release! It is now async first (executor agnostic), with support for no_std out of the box, even including QR generation. The rs-matter repo now [has some examples](https://github.com/project-chip/rs-matter) which can be run on std platforms, including the espidf std port! For `no_std` there are two examples of matter usage, [one using an esp32c3 (blocking)](https://github.com/bjoernQ/matter-rs-experiment) and another using [a rp-2040 (async)](https://github.com/ivmarkov/rp-matter).

## Tooling

### espflash

Just a small patch release to report, `v2.0.1` which added more help text on the CLI commands, and fixed a compilation issue in the `cargo` dependency.

### espsegs

[espsegs](https://github.com/bjoernQ/espsegs) is a tool to see what memory is being used by which sections and where on an esp. Once installed, you can simply point the tool to an elf file, and you'll get an output like below:

## RFCs

This section is mainly for users of esp-rs; we have various issues open in which we would like user feedback.

### esp-hal 

We are considering removing direct-boot support: [esp-hal#803](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/issues/803), if you think this might affect you, please state your case in that issue.

## Talks

Espressif recently hosted their annual developer conference, Espressif DevCon. Myself and my colleague [Juraj Sadel](https://github.com/JurajSadel) did a short talk on using async in Rust, which you can check out below.

I also did a talk at [the Rust Copenhagen monthly meet up](https://www.meetup.com/copenhagen-rust-community/) in August. This talk is more focused on introducing embedded programming to those who already know Rust. Check it out below if you are interested.
