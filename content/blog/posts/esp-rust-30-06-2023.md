This is the next quarterly update of esp-rs effort, detailing the progress over Q2 2023.

## Rust Compiler & LLVM

## esp-hal - no_std

We've been working hard on adding support for async in esp-hal, this includes enabling async serial UART read [#620](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/620) and async serial write operations [#510](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/510). Additionally, we added async support to the I2C driver [#519](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/519). We also implemented support for multicore async GPIO [#542](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/542). Moreover, we made the embassy time driver more flexible by allowing the choice of either timer on chips that support it [#609](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/609).

In terms of DMA functionality, we simplified the user-facing DMA channel types, making them more user-friendly and intuitive [#626](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/626). Additionally, we enabled SPI3 for DMA on ESP32-S3 [#507](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/507). In order to provide support for specific hardware, we introduced initial PSRAM support for ESP32 [#506](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/506) and octal SPIRAM support for ESP32-S3 [#610](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/610).

Other noteworthy improvements include the integration of esp-riscv-rt into esp-hal [#578](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/578). We also simplified the `Delay` driver, derived `Clone` and `Copy` traits, and made relocation optimizations for improved interrupt performance [#568](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/568) [#541](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/541). Additionally, we addressed a bug related to setting the vector base for core1 on Xtensa based chips [#536](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/pull/536).

## esp-wifi - no_std

We have removed the hard requirement for timg0 as the timebase, offering more flexibility, as the hardware timers are limited [#199](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-wifi/pull/199). Additionally, we reworked the initialization process to ensure proper initialization of both the hardware and scheduler [#194](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-wifi/pull/194). 

To enhance WiFi performance, we made preempt improvements, resulting in better overall performance and responsiveness [#185](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-wifi/pull/185). Moreover, we expanded the capabilities of the stack by adding basic IPv6 support [#181](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-wifi/pull/181).

## esp-ieee802154 - no_std

The newly introduced esp32c6 & esp32h2 include an 802.4.15 radio, which is a low-power, low-rate standard intended for embedded devices. The `esp-ieee802154` crate implements the low-level driver for the radio, completely in Rust. This is a big leap from our WiFi drivers, where we interface with binary blobs over the C FFI. There are some useful examples in the repository, including a `sniffer` example to receive raw 802.4.15 frames. In the next few months, we will begin working on getting this driver to work with [`openthread`](https://openthread.io/).

## esp-idf - std

We added safe abstractions to the CRC functions in ESP ROM in [#261](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-hal/pull/261). We also introduced support for WakeupReason from Ext0 events, allowing for more fine-grained control over wakeup behavior [#259](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-hal/pull/259). Additionally, we implemented I2S, enabling communication with I2S peripherals [#232](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-hal/pull/232). Furthermore, we incorporated master changes from the embedded-hal project into our drivers, ensuring compatibility and staying up-to-date with the latest improvements in the embedded-hal ecosystem [#224](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-hal/pull/224).

In the esp-idf-svc project, we focused on expanding the capabilities of the server examples by adding higher-level server examples, providing more comprehensive and practical usage scenarios [#269](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-svc/pull/269). We also exposed a simple safe wrapper for querying rssi when using WiFi [#245](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-svc/pull/245). Additionally, we now support async and blocking adaptors for the WiFi driver [#243](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-svc/pull/243). 

## Tooling

### espflash

The highlight of this cycle was the release of Version 2.0.0, which marked a major milestone for the project and introduced substantial enhancements [#434](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/434).

To ensure compatibility and expand our supported targets, we updated the flasher stubs and bootloaders [#426](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/426) and the supported targets for ESP32-C6/H2 [#424](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/424). Additionally, we improved our CI checks by including the `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` target for comprehensive validation [#422](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/422).

We also invested effort in refining the release and CI workflows, resulting in smoother and more efficient processes [#421](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/421) [#419](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/419). We addressed specific issues such as missing imports for `linux` and `musl` environments [#420](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/420) and improved handling of serial ports on BSD systems [#415](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/415).

In terms of usability and user experience, we eliminated the need for the `--partition-table` argument when erasing partitions, simplifying the process [#413](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/413). We also updated to the latest version of `addr2line` and addressed breaking changes before releasing 2.0.0 [#412](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/412). Furthermore, we improved error messaging by rewording the "elf too big" error and fixed the Windows installation process for smoother setup [#400](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/400) [#399](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/399). Additionally, we introduced a diagnostic feature that informs users about the partition table format, aiding troubleshooting and understanding [#397](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/pull/397).

## probe-rs

We've had flashing support in probe-rs for a couple of years now, but it was only possible to flash a [direct-boot application](https://github.com/espressif/esp32c3-direct-boot-example), but we now support the esp-idf bootloader format in probe-rs #[1629](https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs/pull/1629). We also have improved the performance of using the built-in USB-SERIAL-JTAG peripheral, resulting in up to a 10x improvement in flashing times #[1633](https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs/pull/1633).

## matter-rs

[matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_(standard)) is an open-source connectivity standard for smart home and Internet of things devices, that promises to make smart devices work with each other regardless of which company manufactures them. [matter-rs](https://github.com/project-chip/matter-rs) is a pure Rust implementation of the matter protocol. [@kedars](https://github.com/kedars) and [@ivmarkov](https://github.com/ivmarkov) have been working hard to bring both `no_std` support and `async` support to [matter-rs](https://github.com/project-chip/matter-rs). For more information on the active development branches see [this section of the readme](https://github.com/project-chip/matter-rs#important-note).
